* USER JSON DOCUMENTATION
* In most cases we should just be able to use the username, as this is a unique value, rather than the Json Object.
* For attribution we should probably use userID, as that is a static integer value, we may need to think about deleition keeping this in the database but making it as "deleted user" so we don't have issues with a new user  being assinged an old user ID number.
* We should not store the passwords (hashed or plain text) in the json article, but rather use the secuirty javascript and authenticaiton tokens.
